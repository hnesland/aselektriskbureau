Mapping from Raspberry Pi (V1 B) to Breadboard (Smartduino kind). 

RC - Ribbon Cable

BB - Symbol on Breadboard

Raspberry PI - Meaning on Raspberry PI

Mapping assumes the 15 wide ribbon cable is attached so it is centered and two pins are free on either side (of RPi B) with cable "tooth" is facing inside of RPi.

Notes: 

1. I had to cut two routes on Smartduino Breadboards because they were shorted connecting Pin 9 with Pin 16. nd B7 with B14. I suspect cutting one line (on backside leading to B14) would be sufficient and would lead to Pin 16 remaining connected to B14 allowing access to BCM23.
